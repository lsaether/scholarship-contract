# scholarship-contract

Originally written for the Token Hackathon, this is a contract to facilitate crowdsourced scholarships. 
Each school is taken as the trusted party and will deploy a contract. Students can then make a profile and the school
verifies them. Afterward they become visible to contributors who can send them funds through the ethereum blockchain.
The students are then released funds based on the grades reported by the schools in a programmatically verfiable way.
